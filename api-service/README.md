# API Service Component

The source code included in this directory creates an Express.js API. The API responds to requests from the `WesbiteStatic` Component, and communicates with the application's DynamoDB resource. This directory's `Noopfile` passes in environmental variables (`ENV`) from the application's DynamoDB resource to be available during the container's runtime.
